Simple Swear Replacement filter 1.5
Replaces the chat message containing any swear word with a replacement line from replacements.ini

So anyone who swears will himself be insulted.

Whenever any message is replaced, then the original message containing Swears will be shown to all the Admins (So the Admins know what was said).

Admin messages are not replaced. So they can Swear ;)

Uses swearwords.ini and replacements.ini files. Put these files in the AMX Config Directory. Other swear files can also be used.
You can also add Swear Words and Replacement Lines to the files in between the game whenever you want.

Console Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

amx_addswear < swear word > - To add a swear word in swearwords.ini and start blocking the word from that moment on.

amx_addreplacement < replacement line > - To add a new replacement line in replacements.ini

New :
* Added another feature to counter the people who try to be clever and deceive the swearing filters by adding spaces or special characters (For Example - typing SWEAR as - $WE@R or S W E @ R). This swear filter is capable of catching such tricks and still replace the swear words.
* Added the Player's Name monitoring too. So if any player connects to the server whose name contains any swear word then his/her name will automatically be changed to No Swear

P.S. If the number of swear words or replacement lines exceeds 150 or 50 respectively then change the values of MAX_WORDS and MAX_REPLACE in sma file.
