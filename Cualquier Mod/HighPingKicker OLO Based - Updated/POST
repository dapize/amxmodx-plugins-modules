public Info:

I found problems using the plugin made by "OLO" (sometimes it did not kick the player even though I was watching the ping and was always above the allowed), so I decided to give a little update and modify some things, making clear to the administrators of the site that I am posting just for help if anyone else goes through this.

Oh sure, I accept constructive criticism :D

Notes about changes/updates:

The plugin made by OLO uses dynamic number of arguments in its functions, and for some reason was failing (at least with me), so I made a small update on the way the tasks are created, passing the task ID correctly so as not to confuse with the ID of the player and I modified the cvar for pcvars (this does not make much difference, but who is updating one thing already avails and updates another.)

Requirements:

* AMXX == 1.9 [only]
* Compile locally

Obs:

~> Again, I thank "OLO" for the plugin originally produced, and SmileYzn for countless aids.
