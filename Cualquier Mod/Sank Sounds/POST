This is a port of the Sank Sounds Plugin from AdminMod to AMXX
it has all its features + some new ones (MP3 SUPPORT)

Players can use keyword in chat and than wav files will be played keyword/wavfile combos are stored in SND-LIST.CFG and not hardcoded.

Put the configfile (snd_list.cfg) into this folder: "addons/amxmodx/configs"

The rar file contains some sounds (original sank sounds + new) and the SND-LIST.7z contains an example SND-LIST.CFG.

Code:

Updating to 1.9.0 or greater will require some little cfg file changes ( sry about that )
just add "sound/" (without quotes) to every WAV (so <mod-dir> is root)
eg: misc/haha.wav should now be sound/misc/haha.wav

Since 1.9.0 new configs were added and CVARs removed. Check changelog or help.7z for more info.
