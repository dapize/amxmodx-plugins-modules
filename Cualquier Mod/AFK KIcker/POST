This AFK Kicker should work with any Half-Life mod.

Incase you don't know, AFK stands for Away From Keyboard.

It has 2 cvars shown below with their default values:

mp_afktime 90 This sets the time a player must be AFK (while alive) before he is kicked.
mp_afkminplayers 8 This is number of players required on the server before people will be kicked for being AFK.

Players will receive warnings from 15 seconds before they are kicked. They will also be notified why they were kicked.

A player is determined to be AFK by simply checking if he has moved since he spawned.
Players are only counted as AFK when they are alive.

The plugin has been tested with Natural-Selection, Day of Defeat and Counter-Strike. If you use it for another mod, please let me know that it works correctly.
