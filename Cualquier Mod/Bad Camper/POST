Bad Camper 1.4.239 (released: July 21, 2008 )

This plugin punishes players that camp too long. Camping is a strategy, no doubt about it. However, like most things in life, it's best done in moderation. That's why Bad Camper exists. It allows players to camp but encourages them to not pitch a tent.

There can be a combination of punishments that get applied to a player that camps too long. Punishments start when the player's camping meter reaches 80%. They get worse at 90%. They finally come to a crescendo at 100%.

badcamper_punish <iFlags>
Specifies how a player is to be punished when they camp too long. A value of 0 will disable this plugin.

The flags are additive.
1: Slap
2: Health Reduction
4: Sound (set sound via badcamper_sound)
8: Blind
16: Money Reduction (requires CSTRIKE module)
32: Snark Attack (requires Monster Mod with Snarks enabled)
The default is 12 (snore and blind).

badcamper_sound <iFlag>
Specifies the sound to use as a punishment when the badcamper_punish flag includes the "sound" punishment.
1: Snore
2: Heartbeat
The default is 1 (snore).

badcamper_money <iPercentage>
Specifies the percentage of money taken away when a player's meter reaches 100% when using the "money reduction" punishment.

The default is 10 percent.

badcamper_limit <iSeconds>
Specifies the number of seconds a player can camp in one spot before their camping meter will reach 100%.

The default is 35 seconds.

badcamper_display <iPercentage>
Specifies the percentage at which the meter is displayed to the player. Valid values range from 0 (never show) to 100.

The default is 1 percent.

badcamper_show_spec <0|1>
Specifies whether to allow spectators to see other player's meters.

The default is 1, to allow it.

badcamper_check_all <0|1>
Specifies whether only the team with the current primary objective should be checked for camping or if both teams should.
0: only check the team with the current primary objective
1: always check both teams
The default is 1.

The current primary objective is defined as follows:
if the map is not a "de" map, the CTs have the primary objective
if the map is a "de" map and the bomb hasn't been planted, the Ts have the primary objective
if the map is a "de" map and the bomb has been planted, the CTs have the primary objective
badcamper_immunity_flags <cAccessLevels>
Specifies the access level flags needed for a player to have immunity.

Immunity is achieved by standing completely still and not looking around for approximately 6 seconds. The camp meter will still increase until it reaches 65% or more at which time it'll stop until they move or look around again. If the meter is already at 80% or higher, the meter won't stop.

Set this CVAR to blank to disallow immunity.

For available flags, http://wiki.amxmodx.org/index.php/Ad...#Access_Levels

The default is blank (no immunity).

A common value, when admin immunity is desired, is to use the "a" flag (ADMIN_IMMUNITY).

badcamper_start <iSeconds>
Specifies how many seconds after the freeze time ends each round that the meter will start.

The default is 4 seconds.

Note that camping is checked every 2 seconds so any value you put in here will effectively be rounded up as such.

badcamper_damage_reset <iResetType>
Specifies if the attacker's or defender's meter gets reset when the player is injured by another.
0: No meters are reset.
1: The attacker's meter is reset.
2: The defender's meter is reset.
3: Both meters are reset.
The default is 3.

badcamper_damage_restart <iSeconds>
Specifies how many seconds after a player either gives or receives damage that the meter will restart.

The default is 4 seconds.

Note that camping is checked every 2 seconds so any value you put in here will effectively be rounded up as such.

badcamper_health <iHealthPoints>
Specifies how many points of health to remove from the player every 2 seconds once their meter reaches 100% if using the health reduction punishment. If the health reduction punishment is not being used, this CVAR has no effect.

The default is 10 health points.

badcamper_allow <iPlayerCount|iPlayerPercent%>
Specifies when a team that is being checked for camping is allowed to camp. A value of 0 doesn't allow a team to camp.

The default is 0.

The value can either be expressed as a straight count or as a percentage. If the value is being expressed as a percentage, "%" has to follow the value. Examples below. If the value is a count, players can camp when the number of living players on their team falls to this value or lower. If the value is a percentage, players can camp when the percentage of living players on their team is at this value or lower when compared to the living players on the other team.

Examples:

badcamper_allow 2
Pretty straight-forward. Once there are 2 or fewer players left alive on your team, you can camp.

badcamper_allow 40%
More powerful and complex. Once your team comprises of living players that is 40% or less than the number of living players on the other team, you can camp. For instance (assume your team is listed first) the following match-ups would allow your team to camp: 1v4, 2v5, 3v8, 4v12, 5v13, 6v15.

badcamper_min_players <iPlayers>
Specifies the minimum number of players that have to be connected to the server before players are allowed to camp.

The default is 0 players.

This CVAR affects both badcamper_check_all and badcamper_allow functionality.

badcamper_announce <announcementType>
Specifies how to announce to the opposite team that a player is camping.
0: Make no announcement.
1: Announce via chat.
2: Announce via HUD.
3: Announce via chat and HUD.
The default is 3 (chat and HUD).
