Drop All Weapons On Death


            .: Description :.


As you know, in cs1.6 you only drop one weapon when you die, on cz you can also drop one nade.
This plugin makes players drop all their weapons when they die unless command 'death_drop_rules' is sent to restrict some weapons from being dropped.
Where other plugins fail, this one make the ammo and the bpammo in weaponbox accurate.


            .: Commands :.

    death_drop_rules < flags >

        (flags: abcde..., default: "" : drop all weapons/items )
