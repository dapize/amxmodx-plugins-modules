Introduction:
The original author of this plugin ( unapproved now ) stopped supporting this almost a year ago and his plugin contained some annoying bugs such as the icons constantly being pink.

Description:
This plugin displays your current weapon as an icon in your hud.
Icon colors:
green - sufficient ammo
yellow - last clip of ammo
red - no more ammo left
Cvars:
amx_weapon_location x (0/1/2 - default is 1 ) - If 0 then no icon will be displayed. If 1 then the icon will be displayed on the left side of the screen with the other icons. If 2 then the icon will be displayed by the game clock.
Notes:
- the flash bang and the smoke nade share the same icon because the game developers decided not to make an icon for the smoke for some unknown reason
- I was not able to fix the flashbang/smoke icon because the sprites are read from the hud.txt on client side
