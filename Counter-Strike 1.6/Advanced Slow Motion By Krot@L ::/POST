This plugin may work in more than one mod, but I have only tested it in counter-strike which is why I have dubbed it for CS.

Advanced Slow Motion Plugin By KroT@L
Converted By Seather

Ever want those awesome HLTV effects in realtime? Ever want them in your server? Whether it be LAN or dedicated this plugin will create that for your server.

Be sure to have the module engine_amxx.dll enabled when running this. To do so, go to your modules.ini and uncomment engine_amxx.dll. To uncomment, simply remove the ; in front of the word.

Cvar:

adv_slowmo "abcdef"
a: c4 explosion in slow motion
b: last kill in slow motion
c: grenade kill in slow motion
d: knife kill in slow motion
e: hs kill in slow motion
f: special effect (progressive slowdown)

Any issues with the plugin, such as by the rules, I believe have been addressed by Seather. If not I will PM and see if it can be fixed.

The plugin has one compile error, but still compiles and runs fine in server. Has no errors when running, just that one error in the compiling process.
