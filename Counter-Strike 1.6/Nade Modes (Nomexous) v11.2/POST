Description:
This plugin for CS adds 6 new modes for all the grenades. Simply select the grenade, and right click to change the mode. This plugin is based on the plugin mentioned in credits.

Available modes:
Normal: This is CS's default grenade.
Proximity: This grenade will explode when it detect a player within a certain radius.
Impact: This grenade will only explode when it comes in contact with a solid object.
Trip laser: This is the most complex mode. Throw this at the wall or ceiling, and it will take some time before it will activate.After it activates it will draw a laser. If anyone should blunder into the detection path, the grenade will launch itself in the direction of the victim/ explode (your choice).
Motion sensor: Like the proximity grenade, this detects players within a certain radius, but will only detonate if that player is moving above a certain speed. To avoid an explosion, crouch or walk around this grenade. Be careful, jumping around a motion sensing grenade is risky business!
Satchel charge: When you press the +use button (default e) the nade will explode.
Homing: Seeking the enemy!

Needed modules:
CStrike
Engine
Fakemeta
HamSandWich
AmxModX 1.8.0 and above!!!

Features:
-Control Pannel: To access it, type "amx_nade_mode_menu" or "amx_nmm" in your console.
-Multilanguage: Has an help command that will show what each mode does in your personal language!
-Special effects, use a lot of resource, if you want you can disable them from the control pannel.
-Grenade modes can be selectively enabled or disabled. For example, you can allow player to use the motion sensor mode, but not the proximity mode.
-Choose whether or not to reset the mode of the next grenade to normal once one is thrown. Useful if you don't like to keep changing the mode every time you buy a grenade.
-Choose whether or not to display the current mode of the grenade when a player draws the grenade. Useful for forgetful player who don't remember what they set the grenade to last time.
-Choose whether or not to allow secondary explosions. An exploding grenade will detonate any other grenades close by. If you suspect a trip laser or proximity grenade nearby, you can dispatch it with your own grenade with no danger to yourself.
-Give infinite grenades. Useful for testing purposes.
-Team play (can be set or unset by cvar/control pannel)
-Trip grenades can now be customized when they detect you they will either launch themselves in direction of the victim or imediately explode, your choice.
-New menu system includes many features, you can choose the grenades you want the plugin to affect + you can customize the float cvar values that control the way that the nade modes behave + save system.
-Hitpoints system (nades can take damage! YES!!), Secondary explosions ( more fun!!!), organised menu
-Smart mode for plugin effects (reduces lag!!!) and also Low bandwidth mode
-Low on CPU
-Damage settings for almost everything
-API to make it compatible with other plugins
