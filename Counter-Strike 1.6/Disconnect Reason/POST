    Disconnect Reason

            .: v0.6


Description

This plugin notifies players via chat and console the reason that a player has disconnected (ie. Timed out, Client sent 'drop', Kicked). The standard console message notifying of a player disconnect will not be shown when the plugin is enabled. I've also eliminated the cvars found in the previous release that controlled notification types and notification methods; all types of disconnects are displayed in both chat and console. There is also a forward which allows you to utilize disconnect reasons in your own plugins 'client_disconnect_reason( id , drCode , szReason[] )', see below example. The forward remains active regardless of the dr_enabled cvar value which will only control chat\console message. Made by request.

CVars

    dr_enabled <0/1> - Chat\console notification enabled\disabled status.
        Default: 1 (0=disabled, 1=enabled)


Forwards

    client_disconnect_reason( id , drCode , const szReason[] ) - Forward for client_disconnect with reason.
        id - Player id
        drCode - Disconnect reason code
            DR_TIMEDOUT
            DR_DROPPED
            DR_KICKED
            DR_LEVELCHANGE
            DR_OTHER
        szReason - Disconnect reason in text form: "Timed out", "Client sent 'drop'", "Kicked", "Dropping fakeclient on level change".


Disconnect Reason Codes
PHP Code:
enum ReasonCodes
{
    DR_TIMEDOUT,
    DR_DROPPED,
    DR_KICKED,
    DR_LEVELCHANGE,
    DR_OTHER
} 
Modules

    Orpheu


Installation

    Place compiled (.amxx) file in plugins directory as with any other plugin.
    Place the SV_DropClient file (found in signatures.zip) in amxmodx\configs\orpheu\functions.
    For forward to work in your plugin(s), you must have this plugin running (do not #include it).

Changelog:

    v0.6
        Added 'Dropping fakeclient on level change' disconnect reason.
    v0.5
        Added client_disconnect_reason forward for hooking client_disconnect with reason.
    v0.4
        Removed Sys_Printf hook since I'm pretty sure it is only used for printing to server console which nobody sees anyway so it's pointless to block. I initially assumed it printed to both server and client consoles.
        Added block for message #Game_disconnected to prevent players from seeing "Name has left the game" in console.
        Removed post hook for SV_DropClient since it was not needed.
            v0.4a
                Minor code cleanup
    v0.3
        Improved signature used for SV_DropClient
        Removed cvars for controlling type and method, all disconnect types are notified in both chat and console.
        Added Sys_Printf hook to block the default disconnect message in console.
    v0.2
        Added condition to check that a real player is disconnecting. xPaw reported that a notification appeared with the server name (id=0).
        Changed chat notification from messaging all players individually to a single message to all.
    v0.1
        Initial release
