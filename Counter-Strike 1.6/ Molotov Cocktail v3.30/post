Description

This plugin adds a new type of grenade, the Molotov cocktail. It can be used in addition to the standard grenade (high explosive in CS/CS:CZ, hand grenade/stick grenade/Mills bomb in DOD, hand grenade in TFC), or as a replacement.

This version is based on the last version released by SAMURAI & [ --<-@ ] Black Rose. Some CVARs, default values, command arguments, and file paths have been changed. Please read everything here if you are upgrading. I recommend you delete all of the old files related to this plugin as the zip file below has everything required in the proper path.

This plugin supports Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Day of Defeat 1.2, and Team Fortress Classic 1.5.

I have put countless hours of my time into this plugin and wish for it to work as flawlessly as possible. In return, I only ask that you report any bugs you may find. Either post a reply to this thread, or add a new task to my bug tracker (quick registration required).


Installation

Just unzip the archive into your <modname> directory, (e.g. cstrike, czero, dod, tfc). The location of this directory depends on where your server was installed, but some examples are:

    Linux: /usr/local/hlds/cstrike/, /opt/hlds/cstrike/
    Windows: C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\<username>\dedicated server\cstrike\

* These paths should read:

Once the files are in place, add the following line to plugins.ini:
Code:

Known Issues and (Possible) Future Changes

    When you "drop weapon" with a molotov equipped ("G" by default), the model shown is of the HE (Counter-Strike)
    Multilingual support is missing
    CSTRIKE: Killing hostages doesn't penalize killer
    DOD: Player grenade count not updated immediately
    DOD: Wrong throwing animation played
    DOD/TFC: Molotov doesn't explode after hitting breakable glass
    TFC: Molotov kills allied team players (e.g. hunted) This is due to a bug in tfc_is_team_ally() in AMX Mod X
