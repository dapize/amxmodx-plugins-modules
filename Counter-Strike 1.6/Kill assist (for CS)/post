Kill assist v1.2b (for CS)
Author: Digi (aka Hunter-Digital)

Description:
When a player gets killed, this plugin checks if another player, from the same team, did enough damage to the victim so that he could be an accomplice to the kill and the assister will also receive a frag (all of these are cvar controlled)

Configuration variables and default values:
- amx_killassist_enable 0/1/2 (default: 1)
Enable modes: 0 = Disable / 1 = Enable with DeathMsg / 2 = Enable with HUD message

- amx_killassist_mindamage 1-9999 (default: 50)
Minimum amount of damage to deal to be nominated for an assisted kill

- amx_killassist_givefrags 0/1 (default: 1)
Give or not give the assister frags

- amx_killassist_givemoney 0-16000 (default: 300)
Give or not give the assister some money, 0 disables, 1 or more sets how much money

- amx_killassist_onlyalive 0/1 (default: 0)
Only alive players can be of assistance in killing other players
