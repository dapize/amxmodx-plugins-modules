How to set up ap_prefixes.ini
- When adding new prefix, you should conform that you must set the type of the prefix. There are 4 types: type Flag, type IP, type SteamID and type Name, each begins with the character "f", "i", "s" Ð¸ "n" accordingly.
Here are some examples:
"f" "n" "[PREFIX FLAG]" - this way person with Flag n will have prefix [PREFIX FLAG]
"i" "192.168.1.100" "[PREFIX IP]" - this way person with IP 192.168.1.100 will have prefix [PREFIX IP]
"s" "STEAM_0:1:52985922" "[PREFIX STEAMID]" - this way person with Name m0skVi4a ;] will have prefix [PREFIX NAME]
"n" "m0skVi4a ;]" "[PREFIX NAME]" - this way person with Name m0skVi4a ;] will have prefix [PREFIX NAME]

- If you want to edit who can use the reload command for the plugin's file, open the .sma file and find
PHP Code:
#define FLAG_LOAD ADMIN_CFG 
and edit ADMIN_CFG to the flag that you want (It mustn't be just a character)

- If you want to edit how many prefixes can be loaded, open the .sma file and find
PHP Code:
#define MAX_FLAGS 33 
and edit 33 to any number you want (It is recommended not to be touched)

- If you want the prefix to be coloured, use !g for green, !t for team and !n for noramal colour (It DOES NOT works and with the commands ap_put and ap_put_player)


How to set up ap_bad_prefixes.ini
- If you want to add new Bad Prefix, just write each prefix on new line.
Here is an example:
"[OWNER]"
"[BOSS]"
"[PROSTAK]"
"[IDIOT]" - that way people who can set Custom Prefixes, can not set these.

- If you want to edit who can use the reload command for the plugin's file, open the .sma file and find
PHP Code:
#define FLAG_LOAD ADMIN_CFG 
and edit ADMIN_CFG to the flag that you want (It mustn't be just a character) (same as ap_prefixes.ini)

- If you want to edit how many prefixes can be loaded, open the .sma file and find
PHP Code:
#define MAX_BAD_PREFIXES 100 
and edit 100 to any number you want (It is recommended not to be touc
